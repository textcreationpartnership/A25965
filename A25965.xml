            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough we have not much Newes ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, the Vigilance of Our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, ſo generally beloved, and Our own Inclinations diſpoſing us to Quietneſs and Peace, yet we grow every day more and more ſenſible of the Loſs of the moſt excellent and incomparable young Lady the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Arran;</hi> a Loſs ſo General, as that it hath not onely drowned that Noble Family (which had the Honour of Her Relation) in Mourning and Teares, but all who had the happineſs to know her, in a very Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lamentation: And, truely, as it hath pleaſed God to take her to himſelf, ſo there hath not been wanting any Evidences of Honour to her Memory: And really her Funeral hath been performed with much Grandeur and Magnificence, ſutable to the high Extraction and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Deceaſed Lady; ſo that I take it to be a piece of Juſtice to give you as particular an Account thereof as my own Obſervation could reach.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:31285:3"/>
            <p> The Body, after Embalming, was removed from <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Izod,</hi> where for ſome dayes it lay in Blacks, to a fair new Houſe in <hi>Dammas</hi>-Street in <hi>Dublin,</hi> built by the late Lord Chancellor <hi>Euſtace,</hi> which was thus fitted for its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>The Paſſage from the Great Gate, the large Common-Hall, and all other Roomes below Staires, and the great Stairecaſe, were adorn'd with Blacks and Scutcheons; above Staires there were five faire Roomes hung with Scutcheons and Black-cloath from top to bottom, the largeſt whereof (being the Antechamer to the State) was ſpread with a Foot-cloth of Black-Bayes of about ſix foot wide, leading directly from the Entrance into the State; on the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of the State a large Paſſage-Roome hung with fine Black cloath, adorn'd with Scutcheons, and Back Staires hung with Black and Scutcheons for Perſons to goe away to prevent Diſorder, where ſo great Reſort of Company came.</p>
            <p>The Room wherein the State lay, was hung with me Black Cloath, the very Roofe and Floore all of Black.</p>
            <p>Over the Head of the Body there was erected a Noble Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy, Cuſhions, Foot-ſtool, and Chair of State of Black Velvet, the Canopy adorned with ſeveral Scutcheons, and a Majeſty Scutcheon within it over the Chair, with Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in forme of a <hi>Lozeng.</hi> The ground was rais'd upon which the Corps lay, upon the head whereof on a Velvet Cuſhion was placed a Coronet, upon the Body a Rich Pall of Velvet adorned with Scutcheons upon each ſide the Body; and on the aſcent were placed three Banner-Rolls, and at the Feet the Great Banner and Pennon, within them ten black Stands with Silver Candleſticks, and Virgin-wax Tapers. Theſe all had a Raile without covered with Black to keep off the Crowd; at each Banner-Roll ſtood conſtantly a Gentlewoman attendant, and further off ſeveral Ladies of Quality paid their Reſpects; The whole Room, which was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31285:3"/>fair and high was enlightned with a noble fair ſilver Branch, and ſeveral carved Scenes of the ſame mettle with wax Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and in all the other Rooms ſtood a great number of Gentlemen in deep mourning, who in a decent reſpectful ſilence gave reception to thoſe that came to view that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, which was viſited by all of Quality, beſides multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people which daily reſorted thither.</p>
            <p>After a months thus lying in State, upon the 17th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> inſtant, the Body proceeded towards the City of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> after this form, to the beſt of my obſervation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, two Servants conductors with black Staves on Horſeback; then above ſixty Servants all in black, ranckt in order according to their Quality: after theſe an Enſigne of Honour; then the Gentry and Nobility related, in deep mourning: after them, followed the great Banner, born by an Earles Son a Relation; then the Steward and Comptroller with their Staves; then the Chaplains; then one of the Officers of Armes, with the Cuſhion and Coronet, on his left hand the Counteſſes Gentleman Uſher.</p>
            <p>After theſe followed the principal Officer of Armes alone; then the Body carried in a Hearſe of black Velvet, richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dornd with Shields, Scutchions, Pencils and Plumes, drawn by ſix Horſes covered with black, and adorn'd with Scutchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Hearſe ſurrounded with the Banners, carried by ſix perſons, the meaneſt whereof was a Knight: upon the Hearſe there did attend eight Coaches in mourning; after them near eighty Coaches, whereof the greater part had ſix Horſes apiece.</p>
            <p>Theſe by the diligence of the Officers, without any diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or confuſion, did decently paſs through the City to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> the Gentlemen of the Country in large Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, meeting it upon the Road, moſt of them being in Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The want of Accommodation upon the way for ſo great a Train, and of Houſes fit for the Reception of that noble perſonages Body, forced them to pitch up ſeveral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31285:4"/>Tents, in one of the largeſt whereof hung Scutchions and black; the Hearſe was lodged, attended by Gentlemen in Mourning, wherein there were ſeveral Apartments for the Gentlewomen in Mourning, guarded by ſome of the Royal Regiment deſigned for that ſervice without.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 19th. inſtant, the day appointed for the ſolemn interrment, the Corps was lodged as before in a fair large field, within two miles of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where at the hour appointed there was a very noble appearance of perſons of Quality, and of Gentry from many remote parts of this Kingdom. Theſe being formally drawn into order by the chief Officer of Armes, did afford a very ſolemn, though a ſad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p>The chief Mourner was the Counteſs of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> who with the reſt of the Ladies in their Coaches to the number of ten mourning Coaches, and about 50 more moſt of ſix Horſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece followed the Hearſe, all the men being on Horſeback before, whereof there were about five hundred in black. There were preſent one Archbiſhop, one Marqueſs, twelve Earles and Viſcounts, four Biſhops, ſix Barons, beſides Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens yonger ſons, Baronets, Knights, Eſquires, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, a great number, all in mourning.</p>
            <p>When they came within the precinct of St. <hi>Kennies</hi> Church, all allighted without confuſion, as before, the chief Mourner being ſupported by the Marqueſs of <hi>Antrim</hi> and the Lord <hi>John Butler,</hi> a Gentleman going bare before on the left hand of the Officer of Armes, and the Pall was ſupported by thoſe who were Brothers, or Brothers in Law to my Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>When they came to conſecrated Ground, they were met by the Biſhop of <hi>Oſsory,</hi> with many of the Clergy of his Dioceſs, together with the Dean of <hi>Chriſtchurch,</hi> and his whole Choyre, which waited upon the Hearſe from <hi>Dublin,</hi> for the more ſolemn performance of Divine Service, and from the great Weſt-gate, began their Anthem. The Church we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31285:4"/>found hung with Scutchions and black, and at the Eaſt end was erected a ſumptuous Hearſe of Velvit, richly adorned with Shields, Scutchions, and other glorious devices which paſs my Heraldry to expreſs.</p>
            <p>The Office of Interrment was performed by the Biſhop, and the Body of that ſweet Lady repoſed in a fair Valut wherein the Anceſtors of the noble houſe of <hi>Ormond</hi> did reſt; and though the malice of the late Rebellion did utterly deface and pull down as rich a Monument as this Kingdom, or perhaps moſt others could parallel, yet we diſpair not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in a little time, ſince there is ſo rich a Treaſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the cuſtody of that Vault; and ſince there are ſuch alive, whom God long preſerve, who leave undone nothing which befits the memory of that noble Lady or themſelves.</p>
            <p>After the divine Service and Anthems (which were very ſolemnly and skilfully performed) and the office of Interr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſt, the Officer at Armes, repeated the Stile and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of the Ladies diſcent, which concluded the Ceremony at Church.</p>
            <p>From the Church moſt of all thoſe perſons of Quality did repair to the Caſtle of <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> a ſeat very oble, Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently furniſhed, where Lodgings were provided for the moſt conſiderable; there they found a ſpacious Hall hung with large rich Tapeſtry; and in it, beſides many other Elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, four large Tables covered, and within a little time furniſhed with 3t large ſilver Diſhes at each Table thrice o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the laſt Courſe whereof was an Exquiſite Banquet; of all which Noble Treat, though I am no competent Iudge, yet ſome preſent of Quality and experience proteſt, that in all their Travels they never ſaw greater plenty, variety and order, all this being managed without any noiſe or confuſion.</p>
